This is my Arts and Crafts project for Dreddit.

To run, run the batch file "run_windows.bat" (for 
Windows) or the shell script "run.sh" (Mac OS X or 
Linux). If you change any code, you need to compile
it with either "compile.sh" or "compile_windows.bat",
but if you're changing code you probably already
know that.
